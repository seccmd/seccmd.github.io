# Top Open Source Foundations

## List of free and open-source software organizations

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_organizations

## When nerds made software free again… sh*t started happening.


Open source foundations began to take off and gain popularity as **renegade patrons of the digital Wild West back in the 2000s.**

**In the spirit of collaboration,** online communities arose where the code was at least *substantially* free/modifiable (there might be some paid business add-ons nowadays though!**)** and **builders could create with enterprise-level software tools without worrying** about **restrictive licensing issues** or exorbitant **high costs.**

**It was the 1990s and early 2000s** when open source **started to really take off** as a widespread **movement**… hacker culture, IPOs, Y2K, Elon Musk was almost bald and the **music was 10x less sucky** than today.

**Whoah … not so fast…. Open source \*had\* already existed BEFORE that!**

- **Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), started in the late 1970s and early 1980s.** BSD was a Unix-based operating system distributed by the University of  California, Berkeley, and had a huge impact on many other open-source  projects, including Linux.
- **GNU Project** by **Richard Stallman** in 1983… The GNU operating system, while not a complete Unix  distribution, provided a lot of core utilities that, when combined with  the **Linux kernel** (developed by Linus Torvalds), formed the foundation of many modern operating systems, commonly referred to as **GNU/Linux**.

> “Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. You should think of ‘free’  as in ‘free speech,’ not as in ‘free beer.’” — Richard Stallman

- **The Free Software Foundation (FSF) —** Stallman also founded FSF around 1985 with a primary mission to allow users have the right to use, study, modify, and share software, aligning with the  philosophy of the **GNU Project**. The FSF also focused on legal, licensing, and policy efforts to safeguard these freedoms.

> “The free software movement is about the users’ freedom to control the program and what it does for them.” — Richard Stallman

But now, during the **dotcom tech boom** some important software innovators like **Apache Software Foundation** and the **Linux Foundation** burst onto the scene and made a massive impact **as the dotcom era took off.**

These new .orgs gave it some **structure** where there was none, giving shape to the **rapidly growing tribe of open source developers** who wanted to work together on free code projects.

**No gatekeepers, no barriers and fewer corporate roadblocks**— just a focus on innovation.

“**Open source** ”wasn’t just a **buzzword** or a fleeting trend. Some called it a “**revolution”**, a cultural shift that says, **“Let’s build together.”**

**Some genius nerds had gotten together** and said**, “Let disintermediate the middleman and cut out the gatekeepers.”** And now they were remaking the world into **a world where \*developers\* were substantially more in charge** and software could be freely shared, modified, and distributed without corporate barriers.

**So, why do open source foundations matter?** You gotta have some organization, legal cover, financial lifelines, and the initiatives backbone to keep the dream alive. **They’re the ones making sure that when the dust settles, there’s still a place  where anyone, anywhere, can contribute to something bigger than  themselves.**

**That’s a pretty damn good reason.**
